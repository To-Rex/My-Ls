## Task
it was very difficult. What I like the most is that you have to be very logical.
you must write "make" on the check

## Description
I thought a lot and searched on the Internet.
then i saw something.
I tried to write based on the code I found, but it didn't work.
I tried again and changed a lot of places and got the expected result

## Installation
not Installed

terminal ====> make

## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
